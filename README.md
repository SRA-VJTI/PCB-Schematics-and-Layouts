# Printed-Circuit-Boards
This Repository contains the schematic and layout files for all the PCBs designed at SRA for various competitions and workshops.

- **Robocon PCBs 2016**  
  PCB files made for the *Manually Operated Robot* in **Robocon 2016**.  
  Designed on **Autodesk EAGLE CAD**.  
  - **128 breakout**  
    - This is the breakout board for the *Atmega 128 Microcontroller* SMD Package.  
    - It also consists the External Clock Circuit and a connector slot for the programmer cable.  
  - **Main Board**  
    - The microcontroller breakout circuit is mounted on this pcb.  
    - It contains peripherals like input switches & LEDs, fuses for short-circuit protection and various connectors to connect sensors & actuators to the controller.  
    
- **WallE 2016 Dev Brd**  
  - TPCB files made for the **Line-follower Robot Workshop (WallE)** in the year 2016.  
  - It uses an **Atmega 16 Microcontroller** in its DIP package, with peripherals like input switches & LEDs, fuses for short-circuit protection, external clock circuit,
  programmer slot and various connectors to connect sensors & actuators to the controller.  
  - Designed on **KiCAD**.  
  
- **ESP 8266 Board**  
  - PCB files made for the **IOT Workshop** in the year 2016.  
  - It uses **Espressif System's ESP 8266** SoC.  
  - Contains a switch to toggle between flash mode and GPIO mode. 
  - Designed on **Autodesk EAGLE CAD**.  
  
- **MPU Board**  
  - PCB files made for the **MPU 6050** inertial sensor breakout board, used in the **Self-balancing Robot Workshop (WallE 2.0)**.   
  - It has onboard *Pull-up resistors* for the *I2C protocol* lines (SCL and SDA).  
  - Connects to the main Dev Board through a 6 pin Flat Ribbon Cable.  
  - Designed on **Autodesk EAGLE CAD**.
